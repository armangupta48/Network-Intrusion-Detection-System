# Network Intrusion Detection System
---
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are the second layer of defence. It detects the presence of attacks within traffic that flows in through the holes punched into the firewall. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) constantly monitors actions in a certain environment and decides whether they are part of a possible hostile attack or a valid use of the environment. The intrusion discovery and intrusion avoidance fields are amazingly powerful, with new discoveries, capacities, and models being made constantly. A lot of research on information representation techniques for intrusion location information is additionally right now being led. The conclusion, of this study has shown that the data mining methods generate interesting rules that are crucial for intrusion detection and prevention in the networking industry. We showed how intrusion detection can benefit from high performance computing techniques. This project attempts to address the problem of intrusion attack detection with the use of data mining supervised model.

Machine Learning is implemented for the Intrusion Detection system. The innovative idea for the project was to improve the training accuracy by reducing the overfitting and classifying it better. Along with that this project does not only tell that there is an intrusion but also tell the intrusion through different attacks and classify them into different classes.

#### In summary, the results from this study can contribute towards improving the network security.
